# GIB-S-AUTOS-SALES-ANALYSIS-FOR-2003-2005
This project is a sales analysis for Gib's autos from 2003 to 2005. Its essence is to uncover sales trends and patterns in the data, identify key metrics that drive sales, and then give recommendations that will further drive sales in the future.
The tool used for this analysis is Microsoft Excel.
The data was obtained and cleaned properly to avoid errors in analysis. The cleaning process was done using power query.
Key metrics were determined and then used to run the analysis.

At the end of the analysis and evaluations, the following insights were gained:
 (a). Madrid has the highest sales over the years.

(b). The top customers by sales is the Euro shopping channel.

(d). The country with the highest sales is Spain

(e). The category of the year is classic cars

(f). Best performing year is 2004

(g). The most transaction range is between 2482.13 and 3482.13

(I). 2003 was the year with the lowest sales performance.

(j). Italy had its best sales in 2003, especially in November.
(k). In the 3 years in review, Norway did not make a single ship purchase or sale. All other categories made significant sales volume.

(l). The Philippines being water-surrounded, was expected to buy more ships but instead bought more  classic cars category with sales recorded only between March and November 2003

To achieve better sales in the coming years, the following is strongly recommended;
(a). . A case study for sales activities in Madrid should be extensively done and discoveries of factors driving sales in Madrid should be implemented across all other countries lagging in sales.

(b). The sales team in Norway should be sent for training on how to implement a new sales strategy being that they could not make a single ship sales for 3 years. Also, incentives should be added to ship sales for both the customers as well as the salespersons in Norway.

(c). A further study should be done in Italy to know exactly the reason for the sales drought in some periods. Also, The business should sign MOUs with the Italian Government to reduce tax /import duties on our products when shipped to them.

(d). The Philippines seems to be making more purchases of classic cars instead of ships since it is a water-surrounded nation. A review of ship designs, cost as well as the salespersons in that country should be done immediately to increase sales of ships.
